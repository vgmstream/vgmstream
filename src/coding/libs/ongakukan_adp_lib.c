
/* Decodes Ongakukan ADPCM, found in their PS2 and PSP games.
 * Basically their take on ADPCM with some companding and quantization involved.
 * 
 * Original decoder is a mix of COP0 and VU1 code, however PS2 floats aren't actually used (if at all) 
 * when it comes to converting encoded sample data (consisting of a single byte with two 4-bit nibbles, respectively) to PCM16.
 *
 * The decoder you see here is a hand-crafted, faithful C adaptation of original MIPS R5900 (PS2) and R4000 (PSP) code, from various executables of their games.
 * As a consequence of all this, a new, entirely custom decoder had to be designed from the ground-up into vgmstream. No info surrounding this codec was available. */

/* Additional notes: 
 * - This code does not support PCM16 sound data, in any way, shape, or form.
 * -- Ongakukan's internal sound engine from their PS2 and PSP games allow for only two codecs: signed PCM16, and their own take on ADPCM, respectively.
 * -- However, much of that support is reliant on a flag that's set to either one of the two codecs depending on the opened file extension.
 *    Basically, how it works is: if sound data is "PCM16" (available to "wav" and "ads" files), set flag to 0.
 *    If sound data is "ADPCM" (available to "adp" files), set it to 1.
 * -- As vgmstream has built-in support for the former codec (and the many metas that use it) however, despite being fairly easy to add here,
 *    re-implementing one from scratch would be a wasted effort regardless; it is consequentially not included. */
